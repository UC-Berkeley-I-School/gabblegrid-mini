# GabbleGrid

**GabbleGrid** is a cutting-edge platform designed to enhance service resiliency by leveraging autonomous AI Agents. Our mission is to reduce the impact of service outages in complex IT infrastructures by providing a robust system that can predict and manage potential disruptions.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous AI Agents:** Deploy teams of AI agents that work collaboratively to monitor, predict, and act on potential service disruptions.
- **Service Outage Management:** Reduce unplanned downtime caused by human error, technical issues, or cyberattacks through predictive analysis and automation.
- **Model Selection & Evaluation Platform:** An easy-to-use platform for selecting and evaluating machine learning models tailored to your specific needs.
- **Real-time Log Analysis:** Process and analyze unstructured log data using advanced Transformer-based models to detect anomalies.

## Architecture and System Components

GabbleGrid's architecture is built on the following components:

- **Model Inference Engine:** Runs real-time inference on log data to generate alerts and predictions.
- **Agent Teams:** Specialized AI agents designed for tasks such as log retrieval, user interaction, and automated email generation.
- **Core Infrastructure:** Hosted on EC2 instances with data stored on EBS, ensuring a scalable and robust environment.

## How It Works

1. **Data Observation:** GabbleGrid observes log data over specified time windows and predicts potential service disruptions based on learned patterns.
2. **Model Inference:** Utilizing a Transformer-based model, the platform classifies logs as either normal or anomalous.
3. **Alert Generation:** When anomalies are detected, the system generates actionable alerts, reducing the occurrence of false positives.
4. **Automation:** AI agents work autonomously to handle remediation, reducing the need for manual intervention.

## Why GabbleGrid?

- **High Precision:** Focuses on reducing false positives to ensure that alerts are actionable and trustworthy.
- **Scalable:** Designed to expand beyond initial use cases, including integration with other systems and the addition of new features.
- **State-of-the-Art Technology:** Utilizes the latest advancements in AI, particularly Transformer models, to handle complex log data and long-range dependencies.

## Future Roadmap

- **Enhanced Model Robustness:** Continued focus on improving model precision and recall.
- **Broadened Scope:** Expansion of GabbleGrid to support additional IT systems beyond the initial BG/L scope.
- **Feature Expansion:** Introducing more features and visualizations to enhance user experience.
