                I currently lead a team of data scientists and AI Engineers building AI Autonomous Agents for failure prediction in SaaS cloud services. Concurrently, I am pursuing a graduate degree in Data Science at UC Berkeley, emphasizing practical AI applications and academic research.

As a graduate student at UC Berkeley, I study Natural Language Processing while balancing the demands of a full-time leadership role. I find joy in being both a student and a teacher, an artist, and a technical leader.
